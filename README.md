# MPSServer

This is a solution that starts a server to read and modify MPS models through HTTP and WebSocket.

The server can be started from MPS running normally or in headless mode.

There is also a framework to define web editors interoperable with MPSServer. This framework is called [WebEditKit](https://github.com/Strumenta/webeditkit) and it is open-source.

You can find some basic instructions and an example here: https://github.com/Strumenta/calc-webeditkit-example
